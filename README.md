# Imbalanced-classfication
Project description
Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. The bankers figured out itâ€™s cheaper to save the existing customers rather than to attract new ones.
We need to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. 
## Project Instructions:
- Examine the balance of classes. Train the model without taking into account the imbalance. Briefly describe your findings.
- Improve the quality of the model. Make sure you use at least two approaches to fixing class imbalance. Use the training set to pick the best parameters. Train different models on training and validation sets. Briefly describe your findings.
- Perform the final testing.
